# Password Manager

A secure, full-stack password manager built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with **end-to-end encryption**, **real-time password strength validation**, and modern security practices.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Sensitive data such as passwords are encrypted using industry-standard encryption techniques.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management.
- **Password Strength Validation**: Real-time feedback on password strength using `react-password-strength-bar` and zxcvbn, ensuring users create strong passwords.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt before storage.
- **Frontend & Backend Validations**: Password validation on both the frontend and backend to ensure strong password policies.
- **Secure Data Handling**: All user data is encrypted and securely stored in a MongoDB database.
- **Responsive Design**: User-friendly interface that works across devices and screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, `react-password-strength-bar`
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Security**: bcrypt, zxcvbn, JWT, End-to-End Encryption
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast builds and hot reloading)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB (running locally or hosted on MongoDB Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-manager.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd password-manager/backend
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file with the following:

   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_uri
   ```

5. Run the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

1. **Register**: Create an account with a valid email and a strong password. Real-time feedback is provided during password creation.
2. **Login**: Log in securely with your email and password.
3. **Manage Passwords**: Once logged in, users can store, view, and manage their passwords. All password data is securely encrypted.

## Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted before being transmitted or stored.
- **JWT Authentication**: Protects user sessions with time-limited tokens.
- **Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt to securely hash user passwords.
- **Password Strength Feedback**: Passwords must meet security criteria, with strength validated both on the frontend and backend.

## Testing

- To run tests, navigate to the backend folder and execute:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
